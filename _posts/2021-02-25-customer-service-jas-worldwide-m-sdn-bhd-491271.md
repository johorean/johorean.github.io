<div><div><h4>Company Overview</h4></div><div><div><span><div><div>
<div>JAS is a privately owned international freight forwarder and logistics provider.

<br>
The company was founded in 1978 in Milan, Italy. From modest beginnings by the late 1980&#8217;s JAS had expanded its offices in Europe and the Far East to include Milan, Rome, Florence and Tokyo to meet the demands of its growing customer base. By 1988 JAS became the #1 ranked IATA Freight Forwarder in Italy.<br>

In the 1990&#8217;s JAS was expanding into the Americas with the opening of a network of offices both in North and South America. At the 25 year anniversary meeting held in 2003, the office network had grown to representation in over&#160;240&#160;offices with more than 4000++ employees.<br>
