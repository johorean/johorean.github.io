<div><div><h4>Company Overview</h4></div><div><div><span><div><div>
	Founded in 1975, Tiong Nam began as a small scale cargo business handling consolidated cargo and micro distribution within Penisular Malaysia. Today, we have evolved into one of the largest total logistics service provider in the region with a reputation for efficiency, innovation and most importantly, service par excellence.</div>
<div>
	The company's expansion began in 1978 when Tiong Nam became an incorporated enterprise and in the early 1992, where we extended our reach across the borders of Singapore and Thailand. Since then, East Malaysia and Bangkok has also been included into our trucking and warehousing network.</div>
<div>
	We have also embraced the power of 'integration' to enhance our development. This simple yet effective idea has seen us grow from a mere transportaion business to one that now includes warehousing, customs forwarding, cold room facilities, express delivery and even crane and forklift rental services. At the same time, the company has also invested heavily in IT infrastructure as well as sophisticated handling facilities and equipment for our Distribution Centre in Shah Alam to ensure our constant progress into the 21st century.</div>
<div>
	And having been listed on the KLSE since 1992, Tiong Nam Logistics Holdings Berhad consistently rides high on the Bursa Malaysia, proving that Tiong Nam had instilled confidence not only in our clients but investors too.</div></div></span></div></div></div>
