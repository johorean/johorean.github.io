<div><div><h4>Company Overview</h4></div><div><div><span><div><div>
	MSM Malaysia Holdings Berhad (MSM), incorporated on 10 March 2011, is Malaysia&#8217;s leading sugar producer. It was listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad on 28 June 2011 and is one of the top 60 companies on Bursa Malaysia with a market capitalization of RM 3.5 billion (as at 2014).</div>
<div>
	Principally, MSM operates the sugar business of Felda Global Ventures Holdings Berhad (FGV). It produces, markets and sells refined sugar products. The company conducts its business through two operating subsidiaries, MSM Prai Berhad and MSM Perlis Sdn. Bhd. which were established in 1959 and 1971, respectively. In addition, MSM also operates its own logistics company &#8211; MSM Logistics Sdn. Bhd.</div>
<div>
	Through its subsidiaries, MSM has an impressive combined annual production capacity of 1.1 million tonnes of refined sugar. In 2014, MSM produced 986,115 tonnes of refined sugar products, of which 20% are catered for the export market. Currently MSM accounts for approximately 64% of the domestic market share.</div>
<div>
	In October 2014, MSM strategically underwent a company name change for its subsidiaries. The effort naturally streamlined the business activities under one corporate identity. Changes to the company name were:</div>
<ul>
<li>
		MSM Prai Berhad (formerly known as Malayan Sugar Manufacturing Company Berhad)</li>
<li>
		MSM Perlis Sdn. Bhd. (formerly known as Kilang Gula Felda Perlis Sdn. Bhd.)</li>
<li>
		MSM Logistics Sdn. Bhd. (formerly known as Astakonas Sdn. Bhd.)</li>
</ul>
<div>
	Today, MSM stands proud of its flagship product - &#8220;Gula Prai&#8221;. The 50 year-old home-grown product which carries an approximate brand value of RM80 million, is a proof of the success and heritage values which it inherits from the older generation till current times.</div></div></span></div></div></div>
