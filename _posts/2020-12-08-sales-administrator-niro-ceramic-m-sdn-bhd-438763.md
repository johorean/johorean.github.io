	Niro Ceramic has been around for more than 30 over years. Founded in the year 1979; the first manufacturing plant was established in Cresiano, Switzerland to announce the presence of porcelain tiles to the world. Ever since that, varieties of tiles were exported worldwide and the rapid growth in Asia markets eventually led to the success of Niro Ceramic Malaysia&#8217;s establishment in 1988 and Niro Ceramic Indonesia in 1995. Attribute to the further market demand and expansion of our own capacity, Niro Ceramic established its operation in Foshan, China as an outsourcing operation, where contractors and factories were carefully selected to produce as according to our design and specifications. A complete organization was established in China is to ensure to have the same stringent quality product and efficiency of customer service.<br>
<br>
	The continuous investment and adaptation to meet customers&#8217; demand have caused the further expansion of Niro Ceramic Group&#8217;s network across to Vietnam and resulted in Niro Ceramic Vietnam being established in 2010. On the same year, Niro Ceramic Group has also started its Distribution Centre and Showroom in Alcora, Spain. Having diversity of networks across the globe has resulted Niro Ceramic Group into being the leading suppliers that is backed with large stock keeping to ensure prompt deliveries.<br>
<br>
	For over 3 decades, Niro Ceramic has succeeded in preserving the Swiss Heritage of always delivering high quality products and services to the customers despite having many new product lines and numerous geographical expansions.<br>
<br>
	Moving forward, our people are enthusiastic with the great possibilities ahead.
