<div><div><h4>Company Overview</h4></div><div><div><span><div><div>
<strong>Konica Minolta Business Solutions (M) Sdn Bhd (KMBS) </strong>has come a long way since the incorporation of City Marketing Sdn Bhd (CMSB) in 1981 as the trading arm of Konica Minolta Business Solutions (S) Pte Ltd, (formerly known as Minolta Singapore Pte. Ltd.,). CMSB was initially set-up to take over control of Minolta Camera business in Malaysia. Consecutive years of growth transformed the company into a viable player in the local Office Automation (OA) industry. CMSB takes on a name change to Minolta Marketing (M) Sdn Bhd in August 1988.
	
	<div>
		In August 2003, Konica Corporation and Minolta Co., Ltd. integrated their respective managements and established a holding company, Konica Minolta Holdings, Inc., founded on the concept of creating an entirely new corporate group. After the Management integration, on 1st October 2003, our Company name was changed to Konica Minolta Business Solutions (M) Sdn Bhd, to reflect a stronger identity.</div>
<div>
		As Konica Minolta Holdings Inc. applied the technological strength it acquired to steadily expand its business environment whilst progressively globalizing its operations, KMBS became a major force in the local OA industry. Today, KMBS has become one of the largest organizations and has the widest network in the local OA industry with 14 branches throughout Malaysia.</div>
<div>
		In view of our succession plan, we invite dynamic and suitably qualified individual to fill the above positions in our organisation.</div>
