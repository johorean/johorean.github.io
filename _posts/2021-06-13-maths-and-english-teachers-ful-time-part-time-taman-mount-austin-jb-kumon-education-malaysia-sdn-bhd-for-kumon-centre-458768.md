<strong>Nation-building Through Education</strong></div>
<div>
<br>
	At <strong>Kumon</strong>, what we value the most is every individual child. We aim to develop each and every child's potential to the maximum through the Kumon Method of Learning. Being the world's largest education franchising business with more than 4 million Kumon students in 49 countries, we invite individuals with strong passion for education and children to join us to realise our vision of Nation-Building through education.</div>
<div>
<strong>Cultures and Values</strong><br>
	By discovering the potential of each individual and developing his or her ability to the maximum, we aim to foster sound, capable people and thus contribute to society. "Every child possesses the ability to learn beyond expectations. Learning occurs most efficiently when: (a) The level of the material corresponds exactly to the learner's ability; and (b) The rate of progress is controlled by the student. If students are studying at the "just right" level, their potential will be tapped on. By developing this gift to the fullest, we will develop sound, responsible adults." - Mr Toru Kumon, Founder</div>
<div>
<br>
<strong>Other Information</strong><br>
	The Kumon Method is an instructional method based on an independent or self-learning approach. Created in 1954, by Toru Kumon, a high school Maths teacher in Osaka, Japan. The curriculum consists of hundreds of short assignments arranged in very small steps, each step getting a little bit harder than the previous. The materials are organised into a naturally coherent, logical progression which allows students to advance at their own pace rather than by grade level or age. The daily worksheets are designed to be building blocks to help a child gradually develop fundamental Maths and reading skills needed to master high school (Pre-University) level Maths, languages and reading comprehension.</div></div></span></div></div></div>
