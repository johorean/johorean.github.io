<div><div><div><h4>Company Overview</h4></div></div><div><div><span><div><div>
<div>
<div>
			Our production bases in South East Asia allow us to be close to our supply chains, and access international markets. Malaysia is now Dyson&#8217;s second biggest global hub, bolstered by our Research, Design and Development (RDD) teams in the Philippines and Singapore. And in India we&#8217;re bringing the Dyson story to a whole new audience.</div>
<div>
<br>
			In 2000, Dyson moved production from Malmesbury to Malaysia to be closer to our supply chains and open up international growth. A world-class development centre &amp; a risk was worth taking. Our Johor facility had humble beginnings, but what was originally a few small labs covering 350m&#178; is now a bustling campus occupying 50,000m&#178;. And a team of just 10 has become Dyson&#8217;s second largest office worldwide &#8211; more than 1,200 skilled Dyson people working across Engineering, IT, Finance, Creative and HR.</div>
<div>
<strong>Dyson Malaysia is located in Senai, one of the hubs of Johor&#8217;s Kulaijaya District</strong> &#8211; a flagship zone of the Iskandar Malaysia development corridor. Nearby, there are shops, restaurants and the expressway to Johor&#8217;s luxury shopping area &#8211; the Johor Premium Outlet.&#160;</div>
<div>
			Open plan workspaces, lofty ceilings and huge technology displays create an inspiring backdrop for business. But there&#8217;s also plenty of leisure with regular sports days, charitable activities and the most anticipated fixture on the calendar &#8211; the annual futsal tournament.</div>
<div>
			We start by turning convention on its head. We're family owned, beholden to no one, so we can forge our own path - different and authentic.</div>
<div>
			Never satisfied, we constantly strive to find a better way. We solve problems that others choose to ignore with ingenious new technologies that defy convention and simply work better. In 1993, James Dyson launched the first bag-less vacuum cleaner but a lot has changed since then. As we continue to grow, we&#8217;re exploring new frontiers and traversing the unknown.</div>
<div>
<br>
			In 2012 we were 3120 people. Today we're over 14,500. Our future is bright and the next few years are set to be our busiest yet as we continue to innovate and disrupt with new categories, new machines and launching more demo stores all over the world.&#160;&#160;&#160;</div>
<div>
			We never have and never will stand still.</div>
