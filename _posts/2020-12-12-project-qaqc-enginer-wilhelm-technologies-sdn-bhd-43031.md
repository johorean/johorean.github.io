<div><div><div><h4>Company Overview</h4></div></div><div><div><span><div><div>Our company entered the Singapore business market in the early 1980s as small welding supply distributor and has prospered along with Singapore's economic growth within this region. Wilhelm further developed its reputation as one of the leading welding solutions firm and, in the past ten years has seen operations increaseby several folds. Our company manage to extend our products and services to regional markets like Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and even China. Rigid adherence to quality through every phase of our operation was recognised when we were awarded ISO 9001:2000 certification in 1998.</div>
<div>To keep pace with technology, Wilhelm diversified into high-tech automation welding (Cladding and Laser Hard-facing services), with the oil and gas industry as our primary focus. Perhaps Wilhelm&#8217;s greatest achievement to date is placing Singapore and Malaysia in the spotlight as the leading player in specialised automation welding within the South East-Asia region. We aim to enhance our progress by introducing other technology that serve the varying and ever-changing needs of people in the regional community.</div></div></span></div></div></div>
