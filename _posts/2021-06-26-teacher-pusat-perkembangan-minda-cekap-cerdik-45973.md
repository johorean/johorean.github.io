As it can been clearly seen, such education centers are lacking in Malaysia. Therefore, we encourage publics to take serious awareness of the issue. Support for children does not mean only for children with disabilities. More often than you expect, children struggle with their behavior due to emotions, cannot improve in their studies as no one explore the suitable method of learning for them.</p><p>Thus, we are here to help primarily children to have a happy life. Secondarily, we are creating awareness that it is not abnormal to be different or feel different. Parents should EMBRACE their differences that can actually do more help than harm. We ask our employees to remember that too!&#160;</p><ul><li>Experience teachers</li><li>Interested in teaching, minimal or no experience</li><li>Teaching assistants</li><li>Admin Staff</li><li>Minimal qualification is SPM, school-leavers, fresh grads encouraged!</li></ul></div></span></div></div></div>

<div><div><h4>Company Overview</h4></div><div><div><span><div><p>Welcome on board to EMBRACE! We are a fun filled learning environment for all types of children. We believe every child has their own way of expressing themselves and it is up to us to discover the way of communication with them.</p><p>Similarly, we believe that every child is also able to learn in their own pace and methods. What we are offering, is a chance to let parents discover the skills of their children by letting us open up the inner world of the children, and help them by individualising their learning.</p><p>Fun and learning should be an inclusive process in education. At EMBRACE, we do not separate the two components but use them together to ensure that children are motivated and encouraged to pay attention to the short-timed activities. As we have allowance for timing when compared to official school or tuitions, there is freedom in planning for activities to suit the need of individual classes.</p></div></span></div></div></div>
