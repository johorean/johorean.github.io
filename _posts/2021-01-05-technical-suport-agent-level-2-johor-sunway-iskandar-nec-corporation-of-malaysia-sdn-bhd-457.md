<strong>NEC Corporation of Malaysia Sdn Bhd</strong></div>
<div>
	NEC Malaysia Sdn Bhd was registered on 27th December 1987 and commenced operations on 1st March 1988. This wholly-owned subsidiary of NEC Corporation was set up in response to the Malaysian Government's `Look East Policy' as well as to tap the unexplored market for personal computers and communications products. The initial line of products included mobile phones, key telephone systems, fax machines, ATUR sets, PABX systems, personal computers and printers. Two years after breaking into the market, NEC Malaysia created a niche market for itself in the hand phone and personal computer businesses.</div>
<div>
	This attracted many competitors who eventually saturated the market with genuine and clone products. This and the change in the corporate direction saw the company changing its direction in year 2000. On 27th March 2000, the Company's name was officially changed to NEC Malaysia Sdn Bhd. The change in the name of the Company also brought about the changes in business direction. NEC Systems Integration Malaysia Sdn Bhd aspires to be a Total Solutions Provider with emphasis on systems integration.</div></div></span></div></div></div>
