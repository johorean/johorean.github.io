The Concept was devised to help local producers and manufacturers to fight the growing dominance of hypermarkets by offering a more level playing field to these local businesses by providing an alternative supply channel.</div>
<div>In keeping up with the current trends, S'MART is a single floor complex and offers over 1,000 free car park spaces. With currently over 200 stalls &amp; shops, the development has managed to attract huge crowds due to its astoundingly wide selection of fresh farm produce at competitively low prices besides being a prefect to shop for "fresh" supplies of fish, poultry, meat produce and other household and miscellaneous items.</div>
<div>At S'MART market all fresh produce come directly from their original sources - farmers, fishermen, chicken breeders, manufactures, importers and etc. Such produce are delivered fresh daily and do not go thru any costly middlemen or wholesalers thus, ensuring the lowest best prices at all times.</div></div></span></div></div></div>
